## implementation of a draft of an EIP for rental NFTs with rights management


<br>

* please refer to [this link](eip-9999.md) for the proposal, which follows the guidelines from the [ethereum foundation](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs).
* a reference implementation (in [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)) can be found [here](eip-9999-test/).
* finally, you can check that the EIP is well-formatted by running EF's EIP validator locally:

<br>

```shell
> cargo install eipv
> eipv

draft: 1, review: 0, last_call: 0, final: 0, stagnant: 0, withdrawn: 0, living: 0
valid: 1, invalid: 0
```
