## â›“ðŸ›  blockchain data engineering

<br>

##### ðŸ‘‰ this repository contains my blockchain engineering projects such as scalable event scanners and infrastructure setups for on-chain analysis and machine learning models training (*e.g.*, high-frequency trading with deep learning).

##### ðŸ›  here is a high-level system design chart for a possible blockchain intelligence data platform (all deployed in kubernetes):

### scanners

<br>



* **[ðŸ’Ž token-scanner-api](token-scanner-api)**:
    -  a mvp for a **scalable event scanner cli and api for ethereum**, through indexing and parsing blocks events. this is the first step for training **machine learning models on the chains** (e.g., high-frequency trading with deep learning).
    - check my mirror post **[building a scalable event scanner for ethereum](https://mirror.xyz/steinkirch.eth/vSF18xcLyfXLIWwxjreRa3I_XskwgnjSc6pScegNJWI)**.
